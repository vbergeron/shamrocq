## 1. Parser (`parser.rs`)

**Input:** Scheme source text (UTF-8).

**Output:** `Vec<Sexp>` — a flat list of top-level S-expressions.

The parser is a hand-written recursive-descent reader over a byte slice.
It recognizes:

- **Atoms** — any run of non-delimiter characters.
- **Lists** — `(` items... `)`.
- **Reader macros** — expanded inline during parsing:
  - `'x`  → `(quote x)`
  - `` `x ``  → `(quasiquote x)`
  - `,x`  → `(unquote x)`
- **Strings** — `"..."`, kept as atoms with the quotes embedded.
- **Comments** — `;` to end of line, discarded.

Numeric literals are recognized as atoms and converted during desugaring.
String literals (`"..."`) are kept as atoms with their quotes for processing
in the desugarer.

## 2. Desugarer (`desugar.rs`)

**Input:** `Vec<Sexp>`.

**Output:** `Vec<Define>` — top-level definitions over a high-level IR with
named variables.

### IR types

```
Expr  = Var(name)
      | Int(i32)                   integer literal
      | Bytes(Vec<u8>)             byte string literal
      | Ctor(tag_name, fields)     constructor application
      | PrimOp(op, args)           built-in operation (+, -, *, /, etc.)
      | Lambda(param, body)        single-argument
      | App(func, arg)             single-argument
      | If(cond, then, else)
      | Let(name, val, body)
      | Letrec(name, val, body)    single-binding recursive let
      | Match(scrutinee, cases)
      | Error                      unreachable branch
```

### Transformations

| Source form | Desugared form |
|-------------|----------------|
| `(define name expr)` | `Define { name, body }` |
| `(lambda (x) body)` | `Lambda("x", body)` |
| `(lambdas (a b c) body)` | `Lambda("a", Lambda("b", Lambda("c", body)))` |
| `(f x y z)` | `App(App(App(f, x), y), z)` — auto-curried |
| `(@ f x y z)` | same as `(f x y z)` — explicit curried apply |
| `` `(Tag ,e1 ,e2) `` | `Ctor("Tag", [e1, e2])` |
| `` `(Tag) `` | `Ctor("Tag", [])` |
| `'Foo` | `Ctor("Foo", [])` |
| `42` | `Int(42)` — integer literal |
| `"hello"` | `Bytes(b"hello")` — byte string literal (quotes stripped) |
| `(+ a b)` | `PrimOp(Add, [a, b])` — and similarly for `- * / neg = <` |
| `(bytes-len s)` | `PrimOp(BytesLen, [s])` — and similarly for `bytes-get`, `bytes-eq`, `bytes-cat` |
| `(match s ((Ctor a b) body) ...)` | `Match(s, [case...])` |
| `(let ((x v)) body)` | `Let("x", v, body)` — multiple bindings nest |
| `(letrec ((f v)) body)` | `Letrec("f", v, body)` — single binding only |
| `(if c t e)` | `If(c, t, e)` (lowered to `Match` during resolve) |
| `(error)` | `Error` |
| `(load ...)` | skipped |

All functions are **single-argument** at this stage.  Multi-argument
`lambdas` and application are desugared into nested curried forms.

## 3. Resolver + ANF normalizer (`resolve.rs`)

**Input:** `Vec<Define>` + mutable `TagTable` + mutable `GlobalTable`.

**Output:** `Vec<RDefine>` — resolved IR with numeric indices only.

This pass does three things in sequence:

### 3a. Global registration (first pass)

All top-level `define` names are registered in the `GlobalTable` before any
body is resolved.  This allows mutual recursion between globals.

### 3b. Name resolution (second pass)

Each definition's body is walked and every name is resolved:

- **Local variables** → `Local(de_bruijn_index)` — index 0 is the innermost
  binding.  The resolver maintains a stack of local names and searches from
  the end.
- **Global variables** → `Global(slot_index)` — looked up in the
  `GlobalTable`.
- **Constructor names** → interned to `u8` tag IDs via the `TagTable`.
  Hardcoded tags (`True=0`, `False=1`, ..., `Build_hforest=11`) are
  pre-registered; new constructors get the next available ID.
- **`if`** is lowered to `Match` on `True`/`False` tags during this pass.

### 3c. ANF normalization

After resolution, each definition is rewritten into Administrative Normal
Form: every sub-expression in argument position of `App` or field position
of `Ctor` must be **atomic** (a `Local` or `Global` reference).

Non-atomic sub-expressions are lifted into `Let` bindings:

```
Before ANF:   App(f, App(g, x))
After ANF:    Let(App(g, x),
                App(shift(f), Local(0)))
```

Constructor fields are lifted the same way:

```
Before ANF:   Ctor(Cons, [App(f, x), Ctor(Nil, [])])
After ANF:    Let(App(f, x),
                Ctor(Cons, [Local(0), Ctor(Nil, [])]))
```

This guarantees the stack contains no intermediate temporaries when `BIND`
pushes match-destructured fields — a critical invariant for the stack-based
VM.

De Bruijn indices of untouched sub-expressions are shifted upward to account
for the newly introduced `Let` bindings.

### Resolved IR

```
RExpr = Local(u8)           de Bruijn index
      | Global(u16)         global slot
      | Int(i32)            integer literal
      | Bytes(Vec<u8>)      byte string literal
      | Ctor(u8, Vec)       tag ID + fields
      | PrimOp(op, Vec)     built-in operation
      | Lambda(body)        param is implicit (index 0)
      | App(func, arg)      arg is guaranteed atomic after ANF
      | Let(val, body)
      | Letrec(val, body)
      | Match(scrutinee, cases)
      | Error
```

### Tag table

The `TagTable` assigns stable `u8` IDs to constructor names.  The first 12
are hardcoded to match the VM's `value::tags` module:

| ID | Name |
|----|------|
| 0 | True |
| 1 | False |
| 2 | Nil |
| 3 | Cons |
| 4 | O |
| 5 | S |
| 6 | Left |
| 7 | Right |
| 8 | Pair |
| 9 | Build_root |
| 10 | Build_edge |
| 11 | Build_hforest |
| 12+ | (user-defined, auto-assigned) |

---

## 4. Codegen (`codegen.rs`)

**Input:** `Vec<RDefine>`.

**Output:** `CompiledProgram` (header + bytecode).

### Overview

The code generator walks each resolved definition and emits bytecode into a
linear `Emitter` buffer.  Key design choices:

- **Tail-call detection** — every `compile_expr` call carries a `tail: bool`
  flag.  In tail position, `App` emits `TAIL_CALL` instead of `CALL`, and
  terminal expressions emit `RET` directly.
- **Primitive operations** — `PrimOp` nodes compile their arguments, then
  emit the corresponding arithmetic or byte-string opcode (`ADD`, `SUB`,
  `BYTES_LEN`, etc.).
- **Literals** — `Int(n)` emits `INT_CONST n`.  `Bytes(data)` emits
  `BYTES_CONST len data`.
- **Deferred lambda bodies** — lambda bodies are not emitted inline.  The
  `CLOSURE` instruction is emitted with a placeholder code address, and the
  body is queued.  After all globals are compiled, deferred bodies are
  emitted and their addresses are back-patched.
- **Capture analysis** — before emitting a `CLOSURE`, `collect_free` walks
  the lambda body to find free variables (de Bruijn indices >= the binding
  depth).  These are sorted and deduplicated, then `LOAD`ed onto the stack
  before the `CLOSURE` instruction packs them.

### Compilation context (`Ctx`)

The `Ctx` struct tracks how de Bruijn indices map to `LOAD` slot indices
during compilation:

```
Frame layout:  [capture_0 ... capture_{N-1}  param  bind_0 ...]
LOAD index:     0          ... N-1            N      N+1    ...
De Bruijn:     (captured from parent)         0      ...
```

At frame depth `D` with `N` captures, let `d = D - N` (local bindings
including param):

- De Bruijn `idx < d` → `LOAD(D - 1 - idx)` — local variable.
- De Bruijn `idx >= d` → look up in the captures list — parent variable.

### Global compilation

Each global's body is compiled at a top-level `Ctx` (no captures, no param).
The code offset is recorded in the program header.  At runtime,
`load_program` evaluates each global's code and stores the resulting `Value`.

### Match compilation

For `Match(scrutinee, cases)`:

1. Compile the scrutinee (pushes value onto stack).
2. Emit `MATCH` header with `n_cases` slots (placeholder offsets).
3. For each case:
   - Record the current code position, back-patch the case table entry.
   - If `arity > 0`: emit `BIND(arity)` to push destructured fields.
   - Compile the case body.
   - If non-tail and `arity > 0`: emit `SLIDE(arity)` to clean up.
   - If non-tail and not last case: emit `JMP` placeholder.
4. Back-patch all `JMP` targets to the end position.

### Letrec compilation

1. Emit `CTOR0` — push a dummy placeholder value.
2. Compile the val expression (expected to be a `Lambda`).
3. Find which capture slot (if any) corresponds to the self-reference
   (de Bruijn 0 from the lambda's perspective).
4. Emit `FIXPOINT(cap_idx)` — patches the closure's capture to point to
   itself and replaces the dummy slot.
5. Compile the body.

### Lambda body emission

Lambda bodies are not emitted inline.  Instead:

1. The free variables are computed, `LOAD`ed onto the stack, and a `CLOSURE`
   instruction is emitted with a placeholder address.
2. The body + capture list are pushed onto a `deferred` queue.
3. After all top-level globals are compiled, `emit_deferred` drains the
   queue, emits each body (which may itself defer nested lambdas), and
   back-patches the `CLOSURE` address.

This means all lambda code appears after the global initializers in the
bytecode stream.

### Known-arity direct calls

When the compiler detects a fully-applied call to a known multi-arity global
— i.e., `App^N(Global(g), args)` where N equals the global's lambda-chain
depth — it emits `CALL_DIRECT` (or `TAIL_CALL_DIRECT` in tail position)
instead of the usual chain of `CALL` instructions.

The optimization works in three phases:

1. **Arity computation** — before codegen, `lambda_arity` counts the depth of
   each global's `Lambda` chain.
2. **Call site detection** — `try_unfold_known_call` walks the `App` spine to
   match fully-applied known globals.  When matched, all arguments are
   compiled onto the stack, and a `CALL_DIRECT` with a placeholder address is
   emitted.
3. **Flat body compilation** — after all globals and their deferred lambdas
   are compiled, a second "flat" entry point is compiled for each
   multi-arity global.  This flat body is the innermost lambda's body
   compiled with a flat frame context (`frame_depth = arity`, no captures).
   The `CALL_DIRECT` placeholders are then patched with the flat body
   addresses.

The de Bruijn indices in the innermost body naturally map to a flat frame
`[arg_0, arg_1, ..., arg_{N-1}]` without re-indexing.  Partial applications
(fewer args than arity) fall through to the existing curried code path.

### Output

`CompiledProgram.serialize()` produces the final blob: the header
(global table) followed by the code section.  See [BYTECODE.md](./BYTECODE.md)
for the binary format.
